Bacon\_Colored
==================

Inspired by GreenEggs: [greeneggs by f1337](https://github.com/f1337/greeneggs)

Use It:
=====

```rb
gem install Bacon_Colored
```

```rb
require "Bacon_Colored"

describe ....
  ....
end

```

Note:
=====

  If you use the `bacon -r` option, it won't work. I still don't know why. Examples:
  
  ```rb
    bacon -rBacon_Colored               my_test_file.rb
    bacon -rtests/helpers/my_helpers.rb my_test_file.rb
  ```
